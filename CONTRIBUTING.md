# Contributing
First of all, thank you, that you want to contribute to JTA. There are multiple ways to contribute to the JTA.

1. [Adding Code](#adding-code)
2. [Testing](#testing)

## Adding Code
If you want to add a feature, you can fork the repo and then create a pull request. A staff member will then review your changes and merge them, if they are good. **Only fork of `development`!** If you don't fork of `development`, the pull request will either get a rebasing reminder or, if ignored, be closed immediatly.

## Testing
If you want to test if everything works, just use the API... I guess? And if you find something doesn't work just create an issue?
